# App Factory Documentation

Welcome new and old Developers! We figured out that there is a **ton** of knowledge that a prospective hire to the app factory will need to learn before they can start diving in to our work. Consider this **repo** (repository: a unique storage space for a set of files) like a crash-course on a lot of the **soft skills** needed to work both in the modern workplace and the proprietary skills we use at the app-factory as well.

## How to peruse this repo

The repo that you can see above you will be used to store the sample code projects for each department and descriptions on how to use them. New developers **don't start here**, instead you should start with the [wiki](https://github.com/uwp-af/af-docs/wiki) we created by either following that link or, when on github, by scrolling to the top of the project and moving from the `code` tab to the `wiki` tab. The wiki is where most of the instruction will happen, even instructions about using git to clone this repo and the wiki, and it will link back to the code. 

Otherwise if you are looking just for the sample code, you can go into each folder labeled by department and read the readme inside to find each product and explanations about it.
